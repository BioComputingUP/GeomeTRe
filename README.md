# README

## Files:

- TR_geometry.py id the script.
- TR_geometry_documentation.md is a brief description of the algorithm
- Solenoids_geometry.csv and Propellers_geometry.csv are the outputs of the script when tested on lists of regular solenoids and propellers
- prot_results.csv contains the means and standard deviation of the parameters, calculated on all RepeatsDB
- RepeatsDB_outputs.ipynb contains some plots of the results in prot_results.csv
- Visualize_geometry.ipynb is a notebook with some plots of the distribution of the geometrical parameters for regular solenoids and propellers
